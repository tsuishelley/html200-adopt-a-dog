Google Chrome Testing:
**Tested on latest version of Google Chrome on a 14 inch Macbook Pro.
- Experienced a awkward in-between state on the home page so increased max-width from 768 to 1024.

Mobile Testing:
**Tested on an actual iPhoneX and used the Google developer tool to view the site on an iPhoneXR.
- At mobile sizing, footer description and links became overly narrow. Updated padding left/right from default to 2rem for both sides.
